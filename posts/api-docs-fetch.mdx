# From API Docs to Fetch Requests: Automating Developer Workflow

Working with REST APIs should be easy. Yet, developers often find themselves painstakingly converting API documentation into fetch or axios calls manually, line by line.

## The cost of repetitive boilerplate

Manually wiring up endpoints wastes time and introduces inconsistencies. Developers copy-paste from Swagger or OpenAPI docs, risking typos and missing important edge cases.

## Code generation is your friend

Imagine uploading an OpenAPI spec and instantly getting fully typed fetch or axios hooks. Automation tools like OpenAPI Generator or custom CLI scripts can do exactly that. You write less boilerplate and spend more time on meaningful features.

## Why it matters

Teams can move faster when API integration becomes frictionless. Less manual work means fewer bugs and more consistent code across the codebase.

**Future opportunities**

We need smarter internal tools that generate client SDKs, validate schemas at compile time, and even update code automatically when the API spec changes. As AI tools advance, combining code generation with intelligent suggestions will become the new standard.

**Conclusion**

Stop treating API docs as static references. Turn them into living tools that supercharge your productivity and code quality.
