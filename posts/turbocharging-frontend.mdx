# Turbocharging Your Frontend: Beyond "Start" and "Build"

When you create your first Next.js or React project, `npm run dev` feels magical. But as your apps grow, default setups start to show their limits. You might notice sluggish hot reloads, slow build times, or unpredictable caching issues.

## Why basic scripts aren't enough

Most starter scripts are designed for simplicity, not scale. Once your project includes dozens of components, pages, and custom configs, you need more control over your build chain.

## Embrace Turbopack

Turbopack is Vercel’s next-gen bundler built to handle massive apps with ease. Its incremental updates and intelligent caching make local dev lightning fast — meaning more time building and less time waiting.

## Fine-tuning your dev experience

Try integrating custom npm scripts, e.g., separate "analyze" scripts for bundle insights, lint-on-commit hooks, or partial builds for microfrontends. These enhancements turn your local environment into a robust playground instead of a bottleneck.

## The future of frontend speed

Frontend engineers today are judged not just by design chops but by their ability to deliver seamless, performant experiences at scale. Mastering advanced build tools is a powerful differentiator.

**Conclusion**

Don’t settle for defaults. Dive deeper into build performance, adopt next-gen tools like Turbopack, and stay ahead of the curve. Faster builds = faster iteration = better products.
